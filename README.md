TORCS game config to make it playable with the keyboard, making it a game rather than a simulation

# why?
Because the GNU/Linux game TORCS (aka The Open Racing Car Simulator) is a simulation and needs of some analogue controllers to be played at the top. 
If you want to play it with keyboard you are not able to control throttle and steering the right way and the cars will slick like the are moving on the soap: you will definitely crash and crash!

# and then?
I've made a config file to prepare the game to be played with the keyboard. The car is really stick to the ground, enough to make the game enjoyable but not to make the game too easy.
I've tried to replicate the driving experience of 
Sony PSX: Ployphony Gran Turismo 1

# how to use it?
copy the file preferences.xml in the torcs settings directory
usually is

~/.torcs/drivers/human


where ~ is your home directory. As example, if you are the user
skywalker, you have to copy preferences.xml in

/home/skywalker/.torcs/drivers/human

# hemm
I'm seriously considering you have installed on your GNU/Linux box torcs...
